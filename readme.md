# dotfiles

## Installation 

To install, `cd` into the `dotfiles` directory and run: `install.sh`

Consider executing `./diff.sh` before installing. It will copy the files that would be overwritten when the installation will run. You can then use `git status`
to check what will change and prevent loss of information (possibly generated).

```
./diff.sh
./install.sh
```
